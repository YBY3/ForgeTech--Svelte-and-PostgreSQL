                I chose computer science because I have always had an interest in computers. I built my first computer when <br>
                I was a sophomore in high school so I could play video games. From there that's when my love for computers grew. <br>
                I then got into video game development, specifically programming, and web development. Through the course project <br>
                I hope to gain better skills in web development, specifically frameworks so I can put it on my resume. I also want <br>
                to become a better programmer in general especially when it comes to working in teams. 
                <br>

            Like I said before I like playing video games. I prefer to play on a Computer.<br>
            It also looks like the computer I built back when I was a sophomore so it has a<br>
            special place in my heart!

            I love to play souls games, one of my favorite games of all time is Bloodborne <br>
            although Elden ring is a good game... I think Bloodborne is still better. I also <br>
            wish it gets a remaster one day.
