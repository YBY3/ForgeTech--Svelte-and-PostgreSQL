    I am a passionate and driven Computer Science student at St. Edward's University with a focus on leveraging technology to make a meaningful impact in people's lives, particularly in the field of women's health. With experience in Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and various web technologies, I have a strong background in software development, UI design, and data analysis. My recent work in AI, database management, and game development showcases my ability to blend creativity with technical expertise. My interest in advancing women's medicine and making healthcare more accessible drives me to work on projects that push the boundaries of innovation. Through this project, I aim to further refine my skills in full-stack development, data science, and health tech solutions while continuing to grow as a leader in the tech industry.

    Swimming has been my outlet for the past 11 years, pushing me to my limits and teaching me what I'm capable of. Competing at the national level twice showed me that dedication actually does pay off, even when you're exhausted and questioning everything at 5 AM practice. While I've retired from competition now, there's still nothing quite like being in the water, it's where everything else falls away and I can just focus on the rhythm of each stroke.

      In the next five years, I aim to specialize in Biotechnology, after gaining industry experience. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to address critical health issues and over-looked research areas such as cancer and women’s health.
